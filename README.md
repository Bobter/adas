# Adas
**Adas** is a collection of generic algorithms and data structures. Almost most algorithms and data structures were developed in C++, but also you can find python or java code here.

## Dependences
* Boost (`Test Library` and `Program Options` libraries) (only for tests)
* C++ Compiler with `OpenMP` support
* Python 3.6+ (only for python algorithms and data structures)
* Java (only for java algorithms and data structures)
