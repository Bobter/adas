C++ Algortihms and Data Structures for CC232


# Usage
There are several test that show you how you can use defined template data structures and algorithms.

* To compile all examples:
```bash
make all
```

* To compile examples of `sort` algorithms:
```bash
make sort
```

* To compile examples of `search` algorithms:
```bash
make search
```

* To compile examples that test template data structures:
```bash
make base
```
