# Algorithms
C++ Algortihms and Data Structures for `CC232`.

Almost all algorithms use iterators and the defined data structures use templates, so you can use each algorithm in a variety of containers.  
Also we try to codify some algorithms with `OpenMP` support, so you can use them to process efficiently large amounts of data.

## Developed Algorithms

* `Sort Algorithms`

| Algorithm | Efficiency   |
|-----------|--------------|
| Bubble    |              |
| Bibubble  |              |
| Insertion |              |
| Selection |              |
| Merge     |              |
| HeapSort  | `O(n log n)` |

* `Search Algorithms` (UPDATE)

| Algorithm | Efficiency   |
|-----------|--------------|
| Bubble    |              |
| Bibubble  |              |
| Insertion |              |
| Selection |              |
| Merge     |              |
| HeapSort  | `O(n log n)** |
