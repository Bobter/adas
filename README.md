# Algorithms
C++ Algortihms and Data Structures for `CC232`.

Almost all algorithms use iterators and the defined data structures use templates, so you can use each algorithm in a variety of objects.


# Usage
There are several examples that show you how you can use develped algorithms and  data structures.

* To compile all examples:
```bash
make all
```

* To compile examples of `sort` algorithms:
```bash
make sort
```

* To compile examples of `search` algorithms:
```bash
make search
```

* To compile examples that test data structures:
```bash
make base
```

# Utilities
In [dgen](https://github.com/glozanoa/algorithms/tree/master/dgen) (*data generator*) directory you can find useful **python** scripts to generate random data to test algorithm eficiency.

To learn more about what does a script do, run:

```bash
    python3 PATH2SCRIPT -h
```
